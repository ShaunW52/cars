## Add
The "Add" part of the program appends the Year, Make, and Model of the car to the My_old_cars file. 

## List
The "List" part of the program sorts the list by year and displays it from earliest year to latest year. The code also has a "tr" for translating the colons into spaces.

## Exit
The "Exit" part of the program involves a break to the while loop so the prompting ends.
